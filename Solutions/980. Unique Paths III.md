Unique Paths III: Traversing Non-Obstacle Squares to Reach the End
980. Unique Paths III - https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/description/
# Intuition
The problem involves finding the number of unique paths from a starting square to an ending square while traversing every non-obstacle square exactly once. We can approach this problem using Depth-First Search to explore the possible paths through the grid.

# Approach
1. First initialize variables to keep track of the starting row, starting column, and the count of empty squares.
2. Iterate through the grid to find the starting square and count the number of empty squares.
3. Use a DFS function to explore possible paths from the starting square. During the DFS traversal, we mark visited squares and backtrack when necessary.
4. Move in four directions in the DFS function (up, down, left, right) and continue the search until we reach the ending square and have visited all empty squares.
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
DFS algorithm traverses through each cell of the grid exactly once, making the time complexity O(m * n), where m = rows and n = columns in the grid.
- Space complexity:
O(m * n) as well due to the recursive call stack and the grid itself.

            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    startRow = i;
                    startCol = j;
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    emptySquares++;

        dfs(grid, row + 1, col, emptySquares - 1, paths); // Move down
        dfs(grid, row - 1, col, emptySquares - 1, paths); // Move up
        dfs(grid, row, col + 1, emptySquares - 1, paths); // Move right
